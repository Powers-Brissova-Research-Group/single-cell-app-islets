## Note about data

The data (stored as `.rda` file) was too large for Github's single file limit, so it was chunked into smaller files using the 7zip utility. To re-generate the data file, please use 7zip to extract the data `DATA/Islets.Rda.zip.001` through `DATA/Islets.Rda.zip.004`. 7zip will extract to to `Islets.Rda`, which is what the R Shiny app expects. You may then delete the chunked files.
